# Temperature Monitoring System

## Overview
This project involves creating a temperature monitoring system that uses a temperature sensor to track the temperature and logs the data to a file or web server.

## Components
- **Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35)**: Measures the temperature.
- **Microcontroller (Arduino)**: Collects and processes temperature data.
- **Python Script**: Optional, used for logging and analyzing the data on a computer or server.

## Features
- Measures and logs temperature data.
- Can send temperature data to a web interface or cloud storage.
- Allows for remote monitoring of temperature conditions.

## How It Works
1. The temperature sensor measures the current temperature.
2. The Arduino collects data from the sensor and sends it to a connected system or cloud storage.
3. The data can be displayed on a web interface or logged for analysis.

## Applications
- Temperature monitoring in various environments like servers, homes, or industrial settings.
- IoT-based applications for remote temperature tracking and alerts.
