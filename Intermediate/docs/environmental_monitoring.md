# Environmental Monitoring

## Overview
This project focuses on monitoring environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light levels, and uploading the data to a cloud service for remote access and tracking.

## Components
- **DHT11/DHT22 Sensor**: Measures temperature and humidity.
- **Light Sensor (LDR)**: Measures the light intensity.
- **Microcontroller (Arduino)**: Collects data from the sensors.
- **Wi-Fi Module (e.g., ESP8266)**: Used to send the collected data to the cloud.

## Features
- Monitors environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, and light.
- Uploads sensor data to the cloud for remote viewing.
- Provides insights on environmental conditions in real time.

## How It Works
1. The sensors measure the environmental parameters.
2. The Arduino collects data from the sensors and processes it.
3. The microcontroller sends the data to the cloud via Wi-Fi for further analysis and monitoring.
4. The data can be accessed remotely via a web interface.

## Applications
- Environmental monitoring for smart homes or weather stations.
- Remote tracking of environmental parameters for research and analysis.
