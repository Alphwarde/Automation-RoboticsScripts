# Remote Control Robot

## Overview
This project uses Bluetooth or RF modules to control a robot remotely. The robot can move forward, backward, turn, and stop based on commands sent from a smartphone or a remote controller.

## Components
- **Bluetooth/RF Module**: Used for communication between the robot and the remote controller.
- **Motors**: Control the movement of the robot.
- **Microcontroller (Arduino)**: Interprets commands from the remote controller and sends signals to the motors.

## Features
- Control a robot remotely using Bluetooth or RF modules.
- Capable of moving forward, backward, and turning.
- Easy to interface with mobile devices for control.

## How It Works
1. The Bluetooth or RF module receives commands from a smartphone or remote control.
2. The Arduino processes the commands and controls the motors accordingly.
3. The robot moves in the desired direction based on the commands received.

## Applications
- Educational robotics projects where students learn about remote control systems and motor control.
- Fun hobby project for creating simple remote-controlled robots.
