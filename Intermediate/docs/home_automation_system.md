# Home Automation System

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic home automation system where you can control devices such as lights, fans, or other appliances remotely using an app or an IR remote.

## Components
- **Arduino**: Used as the central controller for receiving signals and controlling devices.
- **IR Receiver/Transmitter**: Used to receive and send signals from the IR remote.
- **Relay Module**: Controls the power to appliances (e.g., lights, fans).
- **Smartphone/Tablet App**: Controls the devices through an IR remote protocol.

## Features
- Control home appliances remotely via IR or Bluetooth.
- Integrates various appliances like lights, fans, etc.
- Provides ease of use through mobile devices.

## How It Works
1. The user sends a signal to the IR receiver through a smartphone or IR remote.
2. The Arduino processes the signal and activates a relay module to turn the appliance on or off.
3. The system can be expanded to include multiple appliances, allowing for a complete home automation system.

## Applications
- Home automation to control lights, fans, and other devices.
- Remote control applications for home environments.
