# Automation Robotics Scripts

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Homam, and I'm a junior developer working on side projects in my free time. My goal is to turn my hobby into a full-time profession, and this repo is one of my steps in that direction.

This project is all about making easy-to-use scripts that can help you with common robotic tasks, like sensor calibration and motor control, and also assist in automating basic operations with Arduino and ESP devices. Whether you're a beginner or an intermediate user, this repository is designed to help you get started or improve your robotics projects.

## Whatâ€™s inside?

- **Scripts**: These are the needed scripts for automating robotic tasks, sensor calibration, and motor control and many more to come.
- **Examples**: Real-world examples that show how to use the scripts in different scenarios like motion tracking, obstacle avoidance, and more.
- **Docs**: Step-by-step guides to help you set up and use the scripts, along with explanations of how everything works.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo** to get started quickly:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alphwarde/Automation-RoboticsScripts.git
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   You can find the requirements in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the Scripts**:
   - Check out the `scripts` folder for the basic automation scripts.
   - Use the `examples` folder to get a feel for how to use them in real-life projects.
   
4. **Read the Docs**:
   The docs in the `docs` folder explain everything in detailâ€”from setting up Arduino and ESP to running specific examples.
